# Weather-Aware Solar Optimization Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Version**: Step 2 of AI Optimization Implementation

---

## Overview

This implementation adds weather-aware solar optimization to the Energy Dispatcher integration, improving battery reserve calculations and planning accuracy by adjusting solar forecasts based on weather conditions (cloud cover and temperature).

## Deliverables

### ✅ 1. WeatherOptimizer Module (`weather_optimizer.py`)

**Location**: `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/weather_optimizer.py`

**Features**:
- `WeatherOptimizer` class with `adjust_solar_forecast_for_weather()` method
- Cloud cover adjustments:
  - Clear (0-10%): 100% of base forecast
  - Partly cloudy (11-50%): 70-80% of base forecast (linear interpolation)
  - Cloudy (51-80%): 40-60% of base forecast (linear interpolation)
  - Overcast (81-100%): 20-30% of base forecast (linear interpolation)
- Temperature adjustments:
  - Panel efficiency reduction: 0.4-0.5% per °C above 25°C reference
  - Below 25°C: No adjustment (baseline efficiency)
  - Extreme temperature clamping (minimum 50% efficiency)
- Confidence levels (high/medium/low) based on weather data availability
- Limiting factor identification (clear/cloud_cover/temperature/multiple)
- Integration with Home Assistant weather entities
- Adjustment summary calculation with statistics

**Data Structures**:
- `WeatherPoint`: Contains time, cloud_coverage_pct, temperature_c, condition
- `AdjustedForecastPoint`: Contains base_watts, adjusted_watts, adjustment_factor, confidence_level, limiting_factor

### ✅ 2. Weather Configuration (`config_flow.py`, `const.py`)

**Changes**:
- Added `CONF_ENABLE_WEATHER_OPTIMIZATION` constant (default: True)
- Configuration option available in setup flow
- Weather entity selector already present (no changes needed)

### ✅ 3. WeatherAdjustedSolarForecastSensor (`sensor_optimization.py`)

**Location**: `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/sensor_optimization.py`

**Features**:
- New sensor: `sensor.energy_dispatcher_weather_adjusted_solar_forecast`
- Unit: kWh
- Device class: energy
- State class: measurement
- Attributes:
  - `base_forecast_kwh`: Base forecast (clear sky scenario)
  - `weather_adjusted_kwh`: Weather-adjusted forecast
  - `confidence_level`: high/medium/low
  - `limiting_factor`: clear/cloud_cover/temperature/multiple
  - `avg_adjustment_factor`: Average adjustment across forecast
  - `reduction_percentage`: Percentage reduction from base
  - `forecast`: Detailed forecast points

### ✅ 4. Battery Reserve Integration (`cost_strategy.py`)

**Changes**:
- Modified `calculate_battery_reserve()` method with optional `weather_adjustment` parameter
- Weather-aware logic:
  - If solar forecast reduced by >20%: increase reserve
  - 20-40% reduction → 10% reserve increase
  - 40-60% reduction → 15% reserve increase
  - >60% reduction → 20% reserve increase
- Detailed documentation comments explaining the adjustment logic
- Logging of weather-aware adjustments

**Benefits**:
- Ensures adequate battery capacity during poor solar conditions
- Helps avoid grid imports during expensive periods
- Compensates for reduced solar production automatically

### ✅ 5. Translations (EN + SV)

**Files Updated**:
- `translations/en.json`
- `translations/sv.json`

**Added Keys**:
- `enable_weather_optimization`: "Enable Weather-Aware Solar Optimization" / "Aktivera Väderbaserad Soloptimering"
- Descriptions explaining the 10-20% reserve increase feature

### ✅ 6. Comprehensive Tests (`test_weather_optimizer.py`, `test_cost_strategy.py`)

**Weather Optimizer Tests** (16 tests, all passing):
- `TestCloudCoverAdjustments`: Clear sky, partly cloudy, cloudy, overcast scenarios
- `TestTemperatureAdjustments`: Below reference, high temperature, extreme temperature
- `TestCombinedAdjustments`: Combined cloud and temperature effects
- `TestMissingData`: No weather data, partial weather data handling
- `TestAdjustmentSummary`: Summary calculation and statistics
- `TestWeatherEntityExtraction`: HA entity integration
- `TestBatteryReserveIntegration`: Reserve increase verification

**Cost Strategy Tests** (4 new tests added, all passing):
- `TestWeatherAwareReserve`: Without adjustment, minor (<20%), moderate (20-40%), severe (>60%)
- Verifies correct reserve increases based on solar reduction percentage

**Total**: 16 + 4 = 20 new tests, all passing

### ✅ 7. Dashboard Documentation

**File**: `docs/ai_optimization_dashboard_guide.md`

**Added Section**: Step 5.5 - Weather-Adjusted Solar Forecast Card

**Features Documented**:
- Basic entities card showing forecast comparison
- Alternative mushroom template card with dynamic icons and colors
- Icon changes based on limiting factor (sunny/cloudy/hot)
- Color-coded confidence levels (green/amber/red)
- Explanation of automatic battery reserve adjustments

**Example Cards**:
1. **Entities Card**: Simple display of forecast data and attributes
2. **Mushroom Template Card**: Visual card with dynamic icons, colors, and formatted data

## Integration Points

### How It Works

1. **Weather Data Extraction**: `WeatherOptimizer.extract_weather_forecast_from_entity()` retrieves forecast from HA weather integration
2. **Forecast Adjustment**: `adjust_solar_forecast_for_weather()` applies cloud and temperature adjustments
3. **Sensor Update**: `WeatherAdjustedSolarForecastSensor` displays adjusted forecast in UI
4. **Battery Planning**: `CostStrategy.calculate_battery_reserve()` uses adjustment data to increase reserve when needed

### Coordinator Integration (Future)

The coordinator should:
1. Call `WeatherOptimizer.extract_weather_forecast_from_entity()` during update cycle
2. Call `adjust_solar_forecast_for_weather()` with base forecast and weather data
3. Calculate summary with `calculate_forecast_adjustment_summary()`
4. Store results in coordinator data under `"weather_adjusted_solar"` key
5. Pass adjustment data to `calculate_battery_reserve()` via `weather_adjustment` parameter

## Usage Example

```python
from custom_components.energy_dispatcher.weather_optimizer import WeatherOptimizer

# Initialize
optimizer = WeatherOptimizer(hass)

# Get weather forecast
weather_points = optimizer.extract_weather_forecast_from_entity(
    "weather.home", hours=24
)

# Adjust solar forecast
adjusted = optimizer.adjust_solar_forecast_for_weather(
    base_solar_forecast=base_forecast,
    weather_forecast=weather_points,
)

# Get summary statistics
summary = optimizer.calculate_forecast_adjustment_summary(adjusted)

# Use in battery reserve calculation
reserve = cost_strategy.calculate_battery_reserve(
    prices=prices,
    now=now,
    battery_capacity_kwh=15.0,
    current_soc=50.0,
    weather_adjustment=summary,
)
```

---

## Performance Considerations

- Weather forecast extraction is lightweight (reads HA state attributes)
- Adjustment calculations are O(n) where n = number of forecast points (typically 24-96)
- Summary calculations use efficient trapezoidal integration
- All operations complete in milliseconds
