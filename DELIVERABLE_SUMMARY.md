## 🎯 Questions Answered

### Q: What working optimizations do we have?

**A**: 10 major working optimization features documented:

1. **Battery Cost Tracking & Optimization** ✅
   - Tracks weighted average cost of energy (WACE)
   - 30 days historical tracking
   - Smart charge/discharge based on price vs WACE

2. **Dynamic Cost Strategy** ✅
   - Classifies prices as Cheap/Medium/High
   - Predicts high-cost windows 24h ahead
   - Calculates battery reserve needed

3. **EV Charging Optimization** ✅
   - 4 modes: ASAP, Eco, Deadline, Cost Saver
   - Multi-vehicle support with presets
   - Deadline-aware scheduling

4. **Solar Forecasting** ✅
   - Option 1: Forecast.Solar with cloud compensation
   - Option 2: Physics-based manual engine (free, no API)

5. **Appliance Scheduling** ✅
   - Optimal time recommendations for dishwasher, washing machine, water heater
   - Shows cost savings and alternative times
   - Confidence levels provided

6. **Export Profitability Analysis** ✅
   - Conservative default (never export)
   - Optional modes for solar excess or peak price opportunistic
   - Battery degradation cost included

7. **Load Shifting** ✅
   - Identifies flexible loads above baseline
   - Finds cheaper time windows
   - Calculates potential savings

8. **Peak Shaving** ✅
   - Uses battery to cap grid import
   - Configurable threshold
   - Safety features for reserve protection

9. **Baseline Load Tracking** ✅

   - Daypart sensors (night/day/evening)
   - Enhanced diagnostics

10. **Hardware Adapters** ✅
    - Huawei EMMA adapter
    - Generic EVSE adapter
    - Extensible pattern

### Q: Can spot price make actual suggestions now?

**A**: ✅ **YES** - Five types of active suggestions:

1. **Battery Charging/Discharging**
   - Recommends when to charge based on cheap hours
   - Suggests holding/discharging during expensive hours
   - Shows next high-cost window sensor

2. **EV Charging Windows**
   - Calculates optimal schedule based on SOC, target, deadline
   - Considers price forecast and solar availability
   - Provides countdown and reason sensors

3. **Appliance Scheduling**
   - Provides specific start times for appliances
   - Shows cost savings vs immediate use
   - Lists alternative times

4. **Load Shifting**
   - Shows "Shift to HH:MM" recommendations
   - Calculates potential savings
   - Identifies current flexible loads

5. **Export Opportunities**
   - Binary yes/no recommendation
   - Calculates revenue vs degradation
   - Shows estimated revenue

### Q: Are we using solar forecast with weather compensation?

**A**: ✅ **YES** - Two ways:

1. **Forecast.Solar with Cloud Compensation**
   - Base forecast from API
   - Adjusts for cloud cover from weather entity
   - Provides raw and compensated sensors
   - Used in battery/EV planning

2. **Manual Physics-Based Engine**
   - Free alternative using weather data
   - Considers cloud cover, temperature, wind
   - Built-in horizon blocking
   - Industry-standard models (Haurwitz, Kasten-Czeplak, Erbs, HDKR, PVWatts)

**Integration**: Solar forecasts are actively used in:
- Battery charging decisions
- EV charging optimization
- Appliance recommendations
- Export analysis

### Q: Can we automatically control battery charging?

**A**: ✅ **YES** - Three decision types:

1. **Charge Decisions**:
   - During cheap price periods
   - When high-cost window predicted within 24h
   - When solar forecast shows insufficient production
   - Calculates required reserve percentage

2. **Discharge Decisions**:
   - During high-cost periods
   - When spot price exceeds battery WACE
   - For peak shaving when threshold exceeded
   - For export when profitable (if enabled)

3. **Hold Decisions**:
   - During medium-cost periods
   - When battery needed for upcoming high-cost window
   - When reserve target reached

**Control Methods**:
- `energy_dispatcher.force_battery_charge` service
- `energy_dispatcher.override_battery_mode` service
- Hardware adapters (Huawei EMMA, etc.)
- Manual overrides always available

**Status Sensors**:
- `sensor.energy_dispatcher_battery_charging_state`
- `sensor.energy_dispatcher_battery_power_flow`
- `sensor.energy_dispatcher_batt_time_until_charge`
- `sensor.energy_dispatcher_batt_charge_reason`

### Q: What should I include in a monitoring dashboard?

**A**: 7 essential cards documented with full YAML:

1. ✅ Status Overview - Price level, reserve, next expensive period
2. ✅ Battery Control - Cost, state, power flow, action buttons
3. ✅ EV Charging - Next window, reason, controls
4. ✅ Smart Recommendations - Appliances, load shift, export
5. ✅ Solar Production - Current, today, tomorrow, forecasts
6. ✅ Price Graph - 24h chart with cost levels
7. ✅ Quick Actions - Button strip for common tasks

All YAML is copy-paste ready in QUICK_DASHBOARD_REFERENCE.md
