# Baseline Load Calculation Simplification Summary

## Overview

This update simplifies the House Load Baseline calculation by removing the complex power-based sampling approach and replacing it with a simpler, more robust energy counter delta method.

## What Changed

### Removed

1. **`runtime_source` configuration option** - No longer needed, only one method now
2. **Power-based sampling** - Complex logic for collecting power samples over time
3. **EMA fallback mechanism** - No longer needed with simple delta calculation
4. **Power sensor dependencies** - `runtime_power_entity`, `load_power_entity`, `batt_power_entity` no longer used
5. **Complex exclusion logic** - Power-based exclusions replaced with energy-based

### Added

1. **`pv_total_energy_entity`** - Total kWh Solar generation counter (optional)
2. **`batt_total_charged_energy_entity`** - Total kWh battery charging counter (optional)
3. **Energy counter-based calculation** - Simple delta method using only start and end values

### Kept

1. **`runtime_counter_entity`** - Total kWh House Load counter (now the only required sensor)
2. **`evse_total_energy_sensor`** - Total kWh EV charging counter (optional, for exclusions)
3. **`runtime_lookback_hours`** - Historical lookback period (default: 48 hours)
4. **`runtime_use_dayparts`** - Time-of-day weighting checkbox
5. **`runtime_exclude_ev`** - Checkbox to exclude EV charging
6. **`runtime_exclude_batt_grid`** - Checkbox to exclude battery grid charging
7. **All baseline sensors** - Same sensors output, just calculated differently

## New Calculation Method

### Simple Delta Approach

Instead of collecting hundreds of power samples and averaging them:

1. Get energy counter value at START of lookback period (e.g., 48h ago)
2. Get energy counter value at END of lookback period (now)
3. Calculate delta: `energy_consumed = end_value - start_value`
4. Subtract excluded energy (EV charging, battery grid charging)
5. Calculate average: `baseline = net_energy / lookback_hours`

### Example

```
House energy counter 48h ago: 1000 kWh
House energy counter now:     1058 kWh
Total consumption:            58 kWh

EV charging (from EV counter): 10 kWh
Battery charged (from batt counter): 10 kWh
PV generated (from PV counter): 5 kWh
Battery grid charging: 10 - 5 = 5 kWh

Net house consumption: 58 - 10 - 5 = 43 kWh
Average rate: 43 kWh / 48 hours = 0.896 kWh/h ≈ 896W
```

## Benefits

### 1. Robustness
- **Missing data doesn't matter** - Only needs 2 data points (start and end)
- **No failed samples** - Can't fail due to "unknown" or "unavailable" states during the period
- **Counter resets handled** - Automatically detects and handles daily resets

### 2. Simplicity
- **Much simpler code** - ~100 lines removed from coordinator
- **Easier to understand** - Clear calculation logic
- **Fewer edge cases** - Less complex state management

### 3. Accuracy
- **Uses actual energy** - Not estimated from power samples
- **No sampling errors** - Delta calculation is exact
- **Better for exclusions** - Energy-based exclusions are more accurate

### 4. Performance
- **Fewer database queries** - Only 2 data points per sensor vs hundreds
- **Lighter on recorder** - Minimal historical data needed
- **Faster execution** - Simple arithmetic instead of complex loops

## Migration Guide

### For Users

If you're currently using the baseline feature:

1. **Ensure you have energy counters** configured:
   - House total energy counter (required)
   - EV total energy counter (optional, for exclusions)
   - Battery total charged energy counter (optional, for exclusions)
   - PV total generation counter (optional, for battery exclusions)

2. **Update your configuration**:
   - Set `runtime_counter_entity` to your house energy counter
   - Optionally set `evse_total_energy_sensor`, `batt_total_charged_energy_entity`, `pv_total_energy_entity`
   - Keep existing checkboxes for exclusions and time-of-day weighting

3. **Remove old configuration** (no longer used):
   - `runtime_source` - removed
   - `runtime_power_entity` - not used
   - `load_power_entity` - not used
   - `batt_power_entity` - not used

### Configuration Example

**Old (complex):**
```yaml
runtime_source: power_w
runtime_power_entity: sensor.house_power
load_power_entity: sensor.house_load
batt_power_entity: sensor.battery_power
evse_power_sensor: sensor.ev_charger_power
runtime_lookback_hours: 48
runtime_exclude_ev: true
runtime_exclude_batt_grid: true
```

**New (simplified):**
```yaml
runtime_counter_entity: sensor.house_total_energy
evse_total_energy_sensor: sensor.ev_total_energy
batt_total_charged_energy_entity: sensor.battery_total_charged
pv_total_energy_entity: sensor.pv_total_generation
runtime_lookback_hours: 48
runtime_exclude_ev: true
runtime_exclude_batt_grid: true
```

## Sensor Requirements

All sensors should be:
- **Cumulative counters** (always increasing, except for resets)
- **Unit: kWh** (or system will try to auto-convert)
- **Recorded in Home Assistant's Recorder** database
- **Available for at least the lookback period**

## Backward Compatibility

The changes are **partially backward compatible**:

- ✅ Existing sensors still work
- ✅ Existing checkboxes still work
- ✅ Lookback period configuration still works
- ⚠️ Need to configure energy counters instead of power sensors
- ⚠️ Old power-based method no longer available

## Troubleshooting

### Baseline shows "unknown"
- Check that `runtime_counter_entity` is configured
- Verify the energy counter has at least 2 historical data points
- Check Home Assistant logs for error messages

### Values seem wrong
- Verify all energy counters are in kWh
- Check that counters are cumulative (always increasing)
- Verify exclusion sensors are configured correctly

### Counter resets cause issues
- System handles resets by using end value as approximation
- For frequent resets, use longer lookback periods
- Consider using non-resetting counters if available

## Technical Details

### Code Changes

**Files Modified:**
- `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/const.py` - Added new constants
- `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/coordinator.py` - Simplified baseline calculation
- `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/config_flow.py` - Updated configuration schema

### Performance Impact

- **Database queries**: Reduced from hundreds to ~4-8 per update

- **Memory usage**: Minimal (no sample buffers)
- **Accuracy**: Improved (exact energy deltas vs estimated averages)

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues or have questions:

1. Check the updated documentation in `docs/48h_baseline_feature.md`
2. Review your energy counter configuration
3. Check Home Assistant logs for detailed error messages
4. Open an issue on GitHub with:
   - Your configuration
   - Error messages from logs
   - Energy counter sensor details

## Credits

This simplification was implemented based on user feedback requesting a more robust, fail-safe approach to baseline calculation that doesn't depend on continuous power sensor data.
