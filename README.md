- You're willing to spend time on initial setup

See [`docs/manual_forecast.md`](./docs/manual_forecast.md) for complete documentation.

**Cloud Compensation (Forecast.Solar):**
- Incorporates cloudiness from your selected weather entity
- User-configurable output factors for 0% and 100% cloud cover
- Exposes both raw and compensated solar forecast sensors

See [`docs/solar_forecast_improvement.md`](./docs/solar_forecast_improvement.md) for details.

## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Tesla Model Y with Deadline Charging

```yaml
# Set up vehicle
vehicle_id: tesla_model_y_lr
current_soc: 40%
target_soc: 80%
charging_mode: deadline
deadline: tomorrow 08:00

# System will optimize charging to:
# - Meet the 08:00 deadline
# - Use cheapest electricity hours
# - Leverage solar if available
# - Preserve home battery for peak hours
```

### Example 2: Cost-Optimized Charging

```yaml
# Hyundai Ioniq with flexible timing
vehicle_id: hyundai_ioniq_electric
current_soc: 50%
target_soc: 100%
charging_mode: cost_saver

# System will:
# - Only charge during cheapest hours
# - Maximize solar usage
# - Take as long as needed for lowest cost
```
