# Energy Dispatcher - Recommended Next Steps

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Current Version**: v0.8.30  
**Status**: ✅ Excellent foundation, ready for focused enhancement

---

## TL;DR - What You Should Do Next

### 🎯 The One Thing To Focus On
**Complete the integration of existing, tested code** (cost strategy & vehicle manager) OR make a clear decision to defer/remove it.

**Why**: You have production-quality code sitting unused. This is the biggest "gap" in the project.

### 📋 30-Day Action Plan

**Week 1: Foundation & Decisions**
1. ✅ Decide on multi-vehicle/cost strategy (integrate, defer, or remove)
2. ✅ Set up proper test infrastructure (pytest.ini, CI/CD)
3. ✅ Organize documentation (move fix summaries to docs/changelog/)

**Week 2: Quick Wins**  
4. ✅ Implement charger profiles (PR-5 from roadmap)
5. ✅ Add configuration bundles (PR-7 from roadmap)
6. ✅ Enable import/export (PR-9 from roadmap)

**Week 3-4: Major Enhancement**
7. ✅ Integrate cost strategy (if decided) OR start device auto-discovery (PR-2)
8. ✅ Update documentation to reflect all available features
9. ✅ Release v0.9.0 with Phase 1 roadmap complete

**Result**: Clean project, Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2

---

## Current Situation (In Plain English)

### What's Great ✅
- **Solid code**: 5,200+ lines, well-structured
- **Excellent docs**: 15+ guides, industry-leading quality
- **Good features**: Price optimization, solar forecasting, battery tracking all work well
- **Clear vision**: 830-line roadmap with implementation details
- **Recent updates**: v0.8.30 with missing data handling improvements

### What's Confusing 🤔
- **Orphaned features**: Cost strategy code exists (301 lines, 21 tests) but isn't used
- **Multi-vehicle**: Fully implemented and tested but archived
- **Too many docs**: 20+ markdown files in root directory - hard to navigate
- **Testing unclear**: No pytest config, unclear how to run tests

### What's Missing 🔴
- **Device auto-discovery**: Users must manually find entity names
- **Setup wizard**: Still single-step configuration (could be multi-step)
- **UI integration**: Some features only accessible via YAML/automations
- **CI/CD**: No automated testing on pull requests

---

## Your Vision vs Reality

**Your Vision** (from future_improvements.md):
> "90% of functionality accessible through the UI, requiring minimal to no YAML configuration"

**Current Reality**: ~60% UI, ~40% YAML

**Gap**: 30 percentage points

**Good News**: You have a clear roadmap to get there! Roadmap estimates ~20-30 days of focused work to reach Phase 2.

---

## Three Paths Forward

### Path 1: Complete Existing Work (RECOMMENDED)

**Focus**: Finish what you started before adding new features

**Actions**:
1. Integrate cost strategy into coordinator
2. Add UI for cost thresholds and battery reserve
3. Decide on vehicle manager (integrate or remove)
4. Complete Phase 1 of roadmap (profiles, bundles, import/export)

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Effort**: Medium  
**Risk**: Low  
**Payoff**: High (unlocks advanced features, clean foundation)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Unlocks existing code investment
- ✅ Provides immediate user value

- ❌ Missed opportunities

---

## My Recommendation: Path 1 (Complete Existing Work)

### Why This Path?

1. **Respect past investment**: You wrote 600+ lines of production code (cost strategy + vehicle manager) with comprehensive tests. Don't waste it.

2. **Clean foundation**: Hard to build new features on top of orphaned code. Clean this up first.

3. **Quick wins**: Most work is done! Just needs integration and UI exposure.

4. **User value**: Cost-based optimization and battery reserve logic will help users immediately.

5. **Momentum**: Completing Phase 1 roadmap will build confidence for Phase 2.

### Detailed Steps for Path 1

#### Step 1: Decision Point (1-2 hours)

**For Cost Strategy** (`cost_strategy.py`):
- **Option A**: Integrate it (2-3 days of work)
  - Pros: Unlocks intelligent battery management
  - Cons: Integration effort required
- **Option B**: Remove it
  - Pros: Cleaner codebase
  - Cons: Loses potentially valuable feature

**For Vehicle Manager** (`archive/vehicle_manager.py`):
- **Option A**: Restore and integrate (3-4 days of work)
  - Pros: Multi-vehicle support
  - Cons: Significant integration effort
- **Option B**: Remove entirely
  - Pros: Simpler codebase
  - Cons: Single-vehicle limitation
- **Option C**: Keep as "advanced users" feature
  - Pros: Available for those who need it
  - Cons: Requires good documentation

**My Suggestion**: 
- ✅ Integrate cost strategy (high value, low effort)
- ❓ Remove vehicle manager for now, add back later if needed

#### Step 2: Foundation Work (1 day)

**Test Infrastructure**:
```ini
# Create pytest.ini
[pytest]
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py
addopts = --tb=short -v --asyncio-mode=auto
```

```txt
# Create requirements-test.txt
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0
pytest-homeassistant-custom-component>=0.13.0
```

```yaml
# Create .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - run: pip install -r requirements-test.txt
      - run: pytest tests/
```

**Documentation Organization**:
```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p docs/changelog docs/technical

# Move fix summaries
mv BASELINE_FIX_SUMMARY.md docs/changelog/
mv CONFIG_FLOW_FIX_*.md docs/changelog/
mv DATABASE_EXECUTOR_FIX.md docs/changelog/
# ... (move all fix summaries)

# Move technical docs
mv IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md docs/technical/
mv IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md docs/technical/
mv MISSING_DATA_HANDLING_SUMMARY.md docs/technical/
```

#### Step 3: Integrate Cost Strategy (2-3 days)

**Code Changes**:
1. In `coordinator.py`:
   ```python
   from .cost_strategy import CostStrategy
   
   # In __init__
   self._cost_strategy = CostStrategy()
   
   # In _async_update_data
   cost_level = self._cost_strategy.classify_current_price(
       current_price, prices
   )
   battery_reserve = self._cost_strategy.calculate_battery_reserve(
       prices, now, self._batt_cap_kwh, current_soc
   )
   ```

2. Add new sensors in `sensor.py`:
   - `sensor.energy_cost_level` (cheap/medium/high)
   - `sensor.battery_reserve_recommendation` (%)
   - `sensor.high_cost_window_prediction` (datetime)

3. Add config options in `config_flow.py`:
   ```python
   CONF_COST_CHEAP_THRESHOLD: vol.Optional(
       vol.Coerce(float), default=1.5
   )  # SEK/kWh
   CONF_COST_HIGH_THRESHOLD: vol.Optional(
       vol.Coerce(float), default=3.0
   )
   ```

4. Update translations (EN/SV) for new entities

**Testing**:
- Run existing 21 cost strategy tests
- Add integration tests with coordinator
- Verify sensors update correctly

**Documentation**:
- Update README to mention cost-based optimization
- Add section to configuration.md
- Update getting_started.md with cost thresholds

#### Step 4: Phase 1 Roadmap Items (4-5 days)

**PR-5: Charger Profiles** (2 days)
```python
# In config_flow.py
CHARGER_PRESETS = {
    "easee_home": {"name": "Easee Home", "max_current": 32, ...},
    "wallbox_pulsar": {"name": "Wallbox Pulsar Plus", ...},
    "zaptec_go": {"name": "Zaptec Go", ...},
    "generic_16a_3phase": {"name": "Generic 16A 3-Phase", ...},
}

# Add selection step in config flow
async def async_step_charger_select(self, user_input=None):
    # Let user pick from presets or custom
```

**PR-7: Configuration Bundles** (1 day)
```python
CONFIG_PRESETS = {
    "swedish_villa": {
        "name": "Swedish Villa (15kWh battery, 1 EV)",
        "price_tax": 0.395,
        "price_transfer": 0.50,
        "batt_cap_kwh": 15.0,
        ...
    },
    "apartment_small": {
        "name": "Apartment (No battery, small EV)",
        ...
    },
}

# Add preset selection in config flow
```

**PR-9: Import/Export** (2 days)
```python
# Add service in services.yaml
export_config:
  description: Export current configuration as JSON
  
# Add handler in __init__.py
async def async_export_config(hass, call):
    entry_id = call.data["entry_id"]
    entry = hass.config_entries.async_get_entry(entry_id)
    export_data = {...}
    # Create persistent notification with JSON
```

#### Step 5: Release & Communicate (1 day)

**Version Bump**: v0.8.30 → v0.9.0
