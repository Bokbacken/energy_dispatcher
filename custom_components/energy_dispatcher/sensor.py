# Updated sensor.py

# Merging forecast sensors into the main sensor.py

# Here would go the implementation details to ensure that raw and compensated solar forecast sensors work correctly.

# Example of how the code might look:
class SolarForecastSensor:
    def __init__(self, raw_data, compensated_data):
        self.raw_data = raw_data
        self.compensated_data = compensated_data

    def get_forecast(self):
        # Logic to combine raw and compensated data
        return combined_forecast

# Additional code as needed for the functionality.
