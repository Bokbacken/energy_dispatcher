# Implementation Summary: 48-Hour Baseline with Time-of-Day Weighting

## Overview
This implementation addresses the issue of house load baseline calculation being too short-sighted when using exponential moving average (EMA). The new system uses historical data from the last 48 hours and provides time-of-day specific baselines for more accurate battery runtime calculations.

## Problem Statement
The original issue highlighted:
1. EMA-based baseline was too reactive and short-sighted
2. Battery runtime calculations were not realistic
3. Need to look at longer timespan (48 hours suggested)
4. Should exclude EV charging and battery grid charging
5. Desire for time-of-day awareness (night/day/evening periods)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Core Implementation Files

#### `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/const.py`
Added two new configuration constants:
- `CONF_RUNTIME_LOOKBACK_HOURS`: Controls historical lookback period (default: 48)
- `CONF_RUNTIME_USE_DAYPARTS`: Enables time-of-day specific calculations (default: True)

#### `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/coordinator.py`
Added three new methods and enhanced existing baseline calculation:

**New Methods:**
- `_classify_hour_daypart(hour)`: Classifies hours into night/day/evening
- `_calculate_48h_baseline()`: Main historical baseline calculation
- `_find_closest_state()`: Helper to find nearest historical state

**Enhanced Method:**
- `_update_baseline_and_runtime()`: Now tries 48h calculation first, falls back to EMA

**Key Features:**
- Fetches historical power data from Recorder
- Excludes EV charging periods (> 100W)
- Excludes battery grid charging periods (> 100W surplus beyond PV)
- Calculates separate averages for night/day/evening
- Provides overall average across all periods
- Clips values to reasonable range (0.05-5.0 kWh/h)
- Graceful fallback to EMA if historical calculation fails

#### `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/sensor.py`
Added three new sensor classes:
- `BaselineNightSensor`: Night hours (00:00-07:59) baseline
- `BaselineDaySensor`: Day hours (08:00-15:59) baseline
- `BaselineEveningSensor`: Evening hours (16:00-23:59) baseline

Each sensor:
- Reports in Watts (W)
- Includes time period in attributes
- Only has values when 48h mode is active

#### `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/config_flow.py`
- Added imports for new constants
- Added default values (48 hours, dayparts enabled)
- Added schema fields for configuration UI

### 2. Translation Files

#### English (`translations/en.json`)
Added labels and descriptions:
- `runtime_lookback_hours`: "Historical Lookback Period (hours)"
- `runtime_use_dayparts`: "Use Time-of-Day Weighting"
- Detailed descriptions explaining the feature

#### Swedish (`translations/sv.json`)
Added Swedish translations:
- `runtime_lookback_hours`: "Historisk återblicksperiod (timmar)"
- `runtime_use_dayparts`: "Använd tids-på-dygnet-viktning"
- Full descriptions in Swedish

### 3. Documentation

#### `docs/configuration.md`
Updated baseline configuration section:
- Added documentation for new configuration options
- Explained time-of-day periods
- Added sensor documentation section
- Included troubleshooting tips

#### `docs/48h_baseline_feature.md`
Created comprehensive feature documentation:
- Overview and key features
- Configuration guide
- Technical implementation details
- Benefits and use cases
- Troubleshooting guide
- Future enhancement ideas

### 4. Tests

#### `tests/test_48h_baseline.py`
Created unit tests covering:
- Time-of-day classification
- 48-hour baseline calculation
- EV charging exclusion
- Backward compatibility with EMA
- Counter method compatibility

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Backward Compatibility
- Default behavior uses 48-hour lookback (better for new users)
- Setting `runtime_lookback_hours: 0` reverts to EMA (for existing setups)
- Counter-based method (`counter_kwh`) continues to work unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing configurations

### 2. Graceful Degradation
- If historical fetch fails, falls back to EMA
- If insufficient data, returns None and uses EMA
- Logs debug messages for troubleshooting
- Never breaks the integration

### 3. Time Period Boundaries
- Night: 00:00-07:59 (8 hours) - typical sleep period
- Day: 08:00-15:59 (8 hours) - daytime activity
- Evening: 16:00-23:59 (8 hours) - peak usage period
- Equal 8-hour periods for balanced averaging

### 4. Exclusion Thresholds
- EV charging: > 100W (avoids noise from standby power)
- Battery grid charging: > 100W surplus (accounts for measurement error)

### 5. Data Clipping
- Minimum: 0.05 kWh/h (50W) - prevents unrealistic low values
- Maximum: 5.0 kWh/h (5000W) - prevents spikes from affecting baseline

## Data Flow

```
1. Coordinator Update Cycle (every 5 minutes)
   ↓
2. _update_baseline_and_runtime() called
   ↓
3. Check if lookback_hours > 0
   ↓
4. If yes: Call _calculate_48h_baseline()
   ↓
5. Fetch historical data from Recorder
   ↓
6. For each historical sample:
   - Check timestamp for time-of-day
   - Check if EV was charging (fetch EV power sensor)
   - Check if battery was grid charging (fetch battery & PV sensors)
   - If not excluded, add to appropriate period bucket
   ↓
7. Calculate averages for night/day/evening/overall
   ↓
8. Store in coordinator.data
   ↓
9. Update sensors
   ↓
10. If 48h calculation fails:
    - Fall back to EMA calculation
    - Continue normal operation
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. More Realistic Battery Runtime
- Based on actual 48-hour consumption patterns
- Time-aware: different estimates for night/day/evening
- Excludes controllable loads that shouldn't affect baseline

### 2. Better Understanding of Consumption
- Separate baselines reveal usage patterns
- Helps identify unusual consumption
- Supports better energy management decisions

### 3. Improved Accuracy
- 48-hour window smooths daily variations
- Excludes EV and battery charging that would inflate baseline
- More representative of true household "passive" load

### 4. User Control
- Configurable lookback period (0-168 hours)
- Can disable time-of-day weighting if not needed
- Can revert to EMA if preferred
