# Quick Start: What Was Fixed

## For Users Experiencing Errors

If you saw errors like:
- ‚ùå `'list' object has no attribute 'lower'`
- ‚ùå `Failed to calculate 48h baseline`
- ‚ùå Sensors showing "unknown" values
- ‚ùå `400: Bad Request` in configuration

**‚úÖ These are now fixed!**

## What You Need to Do

### Absolutely Nothing! üéâ

1. Update to this version
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Everything will work automatically

No configuration changes required. No manual intervention needed.

## What Was Fixed

### Critical Fix: Historical Data Fetching
The integration couldn't fetch historical data from Home Assistant's recorder due to an API compatibility issue. This is now fixed and works with all Home Assistant versions.

**Result**: 
- ‚úÖ 48h baseline calculation works
- ‚úÖ Energy tracking works
- ‚úÖ Sensors show correct values

### Already Fixed: Configuration Flow
The "400: Bad Request" error when opening configuration was already fixed in previous commits.

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Configuration dialog loads properly
- ‚úÖ All settings can be changed

## Informational Warnings (Not Errors)

You might see these warnings - they're normal and don't break anything:

### Weather Entity Warning
```
Weather entity weather.met_no not found
```
**What it means**: Your weather integration isn't loaded yet or the entity doesn't exist  
**What to do**: Check that your weather integration (like Met.no) is installed and the entity exists  
**Impact**: The integration still works, just uses clear-sky calculations instead of weather data

### EV Charger Warnings
```
EVDispatcher: entity button.xxx_starta_laddning unavailable, skipping
```
**What it means**: Your EV charger is offline or the entity is temporarily unavailable  
**What to do**: Check that your EV charger is online  
**Impact**: The integration still works, just skips EV charging control when unavailable
