## 🎯 Key Findings (Executive Summary)

### Overall Status: 🟢 EXCELLENT FOUNDATION

Your Energy Dispatcher integration is:
- ✅ **Technically mature**: 5,200+ lines of well-structured code
- ✅ **Well-tested**: 92 tests passing (1,200+ lines of test code)
- ✅ **Excellently documented**: 15+ comprehensive guides
- ✅ **Modern HA patterns**: Proper selectors, i18n, async throughout

### 2. Vehicle Manager (archive/vehicle_manager.py)
- [ ] **Do you want multi-vehicle support?**
  - ✅ YES NOW → Restore and integrate (3-4 days)
  - 🔜 YES LATER → Document as "planned" (1 hour)
  - ❌ NO → Remove entirely (1 hour)

### 3. Which Path?
- [ ] **What's your priority?**
  - 🎯 Complete existing → Path 1 (RECOMMENDED)
  - 🎨 Improve UX → Path 2
  - 🔧 Maintain only → Path 3

### 4. Time Commitment
- [ ] **How much time can you invest?**
  - ⏰ 1-2 hours/week → Path 3 or very slow Path 1
  - ⏰ 5-10 hours/week → Path 1 (6-8 weeks to complete)
  - ⏰ 20+ hours/week → Path 1 + start Path 2 (3-4 weeks)
