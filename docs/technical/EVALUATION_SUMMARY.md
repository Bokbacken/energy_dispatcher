## üü° What Needs Attention

### 1. Orphaned Features (Medium Priority)
**Issue**: Production code exists but isn't integrated
- `cost_strategy.py`: 301 lines, 21 tests ‚úÖ - NOT used
- `vehicle_manager.py`: Archived - was never integrated

**Impact**: Wasted development effort, user confusion

**Solution**: 
- Integrate cost strategy (2-3 days) OR remove it
- Decide on vehicle manager (integrate, defer, or remove)

### 2. Documentation Organization (Low Priority)
**Issue**: 20+ markdown files in root directory
- Too many fix summaries (BASELINE_FIX_SUMMARY.md, CONFIG_FLOW_FIX_v0.8.24.md, etc.)
- Hard to navigate

**Solution**: Move to `docs/changelog/` and `docs/technical/` (2-4 hours)

### 3. Test Infrastructure (Medium Priority)
**Issue**: No clear testing workflow
- No `pytest.ini` configuration
- No CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- No documentation on running tests

**Solution**: Set up proper test infrastructure (1 day)

### 4. Setup Complexity (Low-Medium Priority)
**Issue**: Users must manually configure many settings
- Manual entity selection (though selectors help)
- Dashboard requires YAML knowledge
- No device auto-discovery

**Solution**: Implement roadmap Phase 2 (PR-2, PR-3, PR-8) - see detailed plan

---

## üéØ Your Vision vs Reality

**Vision** (from future_improvements.md):
> "Create an integration where 90% of functionality is accessible through the UI, requiring minimal to no YAML configuration"

**Current**: ~60% UI, ~40% YAML  
**Gap**: 30 percentage points  
**Progress on Roadmap**: 10-15% (Phase 1: 25% complete, Phase 2-5: 0%)

**Roadmap Phases**:
- Phase 1 (Q1 2024): Essential Usability - 25% complete (1 of 4 PRs)
- Phase 2 (Q2 2024): Advanced Discovery - 0% complete
- Phase 3-5 (Q3 2024+): Intelligence & Integration - 0% complete

## üé¨ Three Paths Forward

### Path 1: Complete Existing Work (RECOMMENDED) ‚≠ê
**Focus**: Finish what you started before adding new features

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Effort**: Medium  
**Outcome**: Clean foundation, Phase 1 complete, all code integrated

**Key Actions**:
1. ‚úÖ Integrate or remove cost strategy
2. ‚úÖ Organize documentation  
3. ‚úÖ Set up test infrastructure
4. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1 roadmap (profiles, bundles, import/export)
5. ‚úÖ Release v0.9.0

**Why Recommended**: 
- Respects past investment (600+ lines of tested code)
- Clean foundation for future work
- Quick wins build momentum
- Aligns with natural progression

### Path 2: Focus on UX Improvements
**Focus**: Make setup dramatically easier (PR-2, PR-3, PR-7)

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks  
**Effort**: High  
**Outcome**: 80% toward vision, significant UX improvement

**Key Actions**:
1. ‚úÖ Device auto-discovery
2. ‚úÖ Setup wizard
3. ‚úÖ Visual dashboard builder
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Defer cost strategy integration

**Why Alternative**: 
- Aligns directly with vision goal
- Major UX improvement
- Attracts new users
- But: Longer timeline, leaves orphaned code

### Path 3: Minimal Maintenance
**Focus**: Keep current functionality, respond to bugs

**Timeline**: Ongoing  
**Effort**: Low  
**Outcome**: Status quo maintained

**Why Last Resort**: 
- Vision goals not progressed
- Orphaned code confusion remains
- Missed opportunities
