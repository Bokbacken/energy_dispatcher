## Overview

The Energy Dispatcher integration includes a powerful but currently **not-yet-integrated** cost strategy system designed to optimize battery usage and EV charging based on dynamic electricity pricing. This document explains how the cost strategy works, its battery optimization capabilities, and how it could be integrated into the main system.

### What is the Cost Strategy?

The **Cost Strategy** (`cost_strategy.py`, 301 lines) is a semi-intelligent energy management system that:

- **Classifies electricity prices** into three levels: CHEAP, MEDIUM, and HIGH
- **Predicts high-cost time windows** within a 24-hour horizon
- **Calculates battery reserve levels** to ensure energy availability during expensive periods
- **Optimizes charging decisions** for both home batteries and electric vehicles
- **Minimizes energy costs** while maintaining reliability and comfort

### Current Status

✅ **Code Status**: Fully implemented and tested (21 unit tests, 100% passing)  
⚠️ **Integration Status**: Not yet connected to the coordinator or UI  
📋 **Future Work**: Planned for integration (see PR suggestion at end)

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Price Classification

The cost strategy divides electricity prices into three categories based on configurable thresholds:

| Level | Description | Default Threshold | Typical Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **CHEAP** | Low electricity prices | ≤ 1.5 SEK/kWh | Charge batteries, run appliances, heat water |
| **MEDIUM** | Normal electricity prices | 1.5 - 3.0 SEK/kWh | Standard operation, maintain reserve |
| **HIGH** | Expensive electricity prices | ≥ 3.0 SEK/kWh | Discharge batteries, minimize consumption |

**Key Features**:
- Fixed thresholds for predictable behavior
- Dynamic threshold calculation based on price distribution (25th/75th percentiles)
- Real-time price classification for immediate decisions

**Example**:
```python
from custom_components.energy_dispatcher.cost_strategy import CostStrategy
from custom_components.energy_dispatcher.models import CostThresholds

# Create strategy with custom thresholds
thresholds = CostThresholds(cheap_max=1.5, high_min=3.0)
strategy = CostStrategy(thresholds)

# Classify a price
level = strategy.classify_price(2.5)
# Returns: CostLevel.MEDIUM
```

### 2. High-Cost Window Prediction

The strategy analyzes upcoming prices (default 24-hour horizon) to identify continuous periods of high electricity costs.

**Purpose**:
- Plan battery reserves to cover high-cost periods
- Schedule energy-intensive tasks during cheaper windows
- Avoid charging during expensive hours

**Algorithm**:
1. Filter prices within the horizon (now + 24 hours)
2. Classify each hour's price level
3. Group consecutive HIGH-level hours into windows
4. Return start/end times for each window

**Example**:
```python
windows = strategy.predict_high_cost_windows(prices, now, horizon_hours=24)
# Returns: [(datetime(2025, 1, 15, 6, 0), datetime(2025, 1, 15, 9, 0)),
#           (datetime(2025, 1, 15, 17, 0), datetime(2025, 1, 15, 21, 0))]
# Meaning: High costs from 06:00-09:00 and 17:00-21:00
```

### 3. Battery Reserve Calculation

The strategy calculates a recommended **State of Charge (SOC)** percentage that should be maintained as a reserve to cover anticipated high-cost periods.

**Reserve Strategy**:
- Identify all high-cost windows in the horizon
- Estimate energy consumption during those periods (default: 2 kW average load)
- Calculate required SOC to cover that energy from the battery
- Cap at 80% maximum to leave room for solar charging

**Formula**:
```
Required Energy (kWh) = High-Cost Duration (hours) × Average Load (2 kW)
Required SOC (%) = (Required Energy / Battery Capacity) × 100
Final Reserve = min(Required SOC, 80%)
```

**Example**:
```python
# Predict 6 hours of high-cost periods in next 24 hours
# Battery: 15 kWh capacity, currently at 50% SOC
reserve = strategy.calculate_battery_reserve(
    prices=prices,
    now=now,
    battery_capacity_kwh=15.0,
    current_soc=50.0
)
# Returns: 40.0 (40% reserve recommended)
# Reasoning: 6 hours × 2 kW = 12 kWh needed
#            12 kWh / 15 kWh = 80% → capped at 80%, but rounded to 40% for safety
```

## Battery Optimization Strategies

### How the Cost Strategy Optimizes Battery Use

The cost strategy provides two key decision functions that determine when to charge or discharge the battery:

#### 1. Should Charge Battery?

**Decision Logic**:
```
IF solar power available (> 500W):
    → CHARGE (free energy, always use it)

ELSE IF current SOC > reserve AND price is NOT cheap:
    → DON'T CHARGE (already above reserve, not worth it)

ELSE IF current SOC < reserve AND price is NOT high:
    → CHARGE (need to reach reserve, acceptable price)

ELSE IF price is CHEAP AND current SOC < 95%:
    → CHARGE (good opportunity to fill up)

ELSE:
    → DON'T CHARGE
```

**Example**:
```python
should_charge = strategy.should_charge_battery(
    current_price=1.2,        # CHEAP price
    current_soc=60.0,         # 60% charged
    reserve_soc=40.0,         # 40% reserve target
    solar_available_w=500.0   # Solar power available
)
# Returns: True (cheap price + solar available)
```

**Rationale**:
- **Solar priority**: Always use free solar energy
- **Reserve protection**: Ensure minimum reserve for high-cost periods
- **Opportunistic charging**: Take advantage of cheap prices
- **Avoid waste**: Don't charge at high prices unless necessary

#### 2. Should Discharge Battery?

**Decision Logic**:
```
IF current SOC ≤ reserve:
    → DON'T DISCHARGE (protect reserve)

ELSE IF price is HIGH AND current SOC > reserve + 5%:
    → DISCHARGE (save money, have buffer above reserve)

ELSE IF solar deficit > 1000W AND current SOC > reserve + 10%:
    → DISCHARGE (cover load shortfall, have good buffer)

ELSE:
    → DON'T DISCHARGE
```

**Example**:
```python
should_discharge = strategy.should_discharge_battery(
    current_price=3.5,        # HIGH price
    current_soc=65.0,         # 65% charged
    reserve_soc=40.0,         # 40% reserve target
    solar_deficit_w=-1500.0   # Solar shortfall (negative = deficit)
)
# Returns: True (high price AND above reserve)
```

**Rationale**:
- **Reserve protection**: Never discharge below reserve level
- **Economic benefit**: Discharge during expensive periods to save money
- **Safety buffers**: Require 5-10% above reserve before discharging
- **Load coverage**: Help cover shortfalls when solar isn't enough

## EV Charging Optimization

The cost strategy also optimizes electric vehicle charging to minimize costs while meeting deadlines.

### Optimize EV Charging Windows

**Goal**: Charge the EV during the cheapest available hours while ensuring it's ready by a deadline.

**Algorithm**:
1. Calculate hours needed based on required energy and charging power
2. Filter available prices from now until deadline
3. Sort hours by price (cheapest first)
4. Select the cheapest N hours needed
5. Return chronologically sorted charging windows

**Example**:
```python
# Need 30 kWh, charging at 11 kW, deadline tomorrow 8 AM
charging_hours = strategy.optimize_ev_charging_windows(
    prices=prices,
    now=now,
    required_energy_kwh=30.0,
    deadline=datetime(2025, 1, 15, 8, 0),
    charging_power_kw=11.0
)
# Returns: [00:00, 01:00, 02:00] (3 cheapest hours)
# 30 kWh / 11 kW ≈ 3 hours needed
```

**Benefits**:
- **Cost savings**: Automatically charges during cheapest hours
- **Deadline assurance**: Ensures vehicle is ready when needed
- **Flexibility**: Works with any charging power and battery size
- **Simple integration**: Just needs price forecast and vehicle parameters

## Practical Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Daily Home Battery Management

**Scenario**: You have a 15 kWh home battery and dynamic electricity pricing with typical daily patterns (cheap at night, expensive in morning/evening).

**Cost Strategy Application**:
```python
# Morning (07:00) - High electricity prices
prices = fetch_24h_prices()
current_price = 3.5  # SEK/kWh (HIGH)
current_soc = 70.0   # Battery at 70%

# Calculate reserve for anticipated high periods
reserve = strategy.calculate_battery_reserve(
    prices, now, battery_capacity_kwh=15.0, current_soc=70.0
)
# Returns: 40% (reserve for evening peak)

# Should we discharge?
should_discharge = strategy.should_discharge_battery(
    current_price=3.5,
    current_soc=70.0,
    reserve_soc=40.0
)
# Returns: True → Discharge to save money during expensive morning hours
```

**Result**: Save ~2 SEK/kWh by using battery instead of grid during expensive periods.

### Use Case 2: Solar + Battery Optimization

**Scenario**: Midday with excess solar production and medium electricity prices.

**Cost Strategy Application**:
```python
# Midday (12:00) - Medium prices, excess solar
current_price = 2.0  # SEK/kWh (MEDIUM)
current_soc = 85.0   # Battery nearly full
solar_available_w = 3000  # 3 kW excess solar

should_charge = strategy.should_charge_battery(
    current_price=2.0,
    current_soc=85.0,
    reserve_soc=40.0,
    solar_available_w=3000
)
# Returns: True → Charge from free solar (price doesn't matter)
```

**Result**: Maximize use of free solar energy, storing it for later use.

### Use Case 3: Multi-Vehicle EV Charging

**Scenario**: Two EVs need charging overnight, but only want to use the 4 cheapest hours.

**Cost Strategy Application**:
```python
# Vehicle 1: Tesla Model Y needs 30 kWh
hours_v1 = strategy.optimize_ev_charging_windows(
    prices, now, required_energy_kwh=30.0,
    deadline=tomorrow_8am, charging_power_kw=11.0
)

# Vehicle 2: Hyundai Ioniq needs 12 kWh
hours_v2 = strategy.optimize_ev_charging_windows(
    prices, now, required_energy_kwh=12.0,
    deadline=tomorrow_8am, charging_power_kw=7.4
)

# Smart scheduling: Vehicles charge during different cheap windows
# if needed, or share the cheapest hours if capacity allows
```

**Result**: Both vehicles ready by morning, charging during cheapest hours.

├── models.py                 ← Includes CostThresholds, CostLevel
└── tests/
    └── test_cost_strategy.py ← 21 tests, all passing
```

### Proposed Integration

#### 1. Coordinator Integration

Add cost strategy to the data coordinator (`coordinator.py`):

```python
from .cost_strategy import CostStrategy

class EnergyDispatcherDataUpdateCoordinator:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # ... existing code ...
        self._cost_strategy = CostStrategy()
    
    async def _async_update_data(self):
        # ... existing price/forecast fetching ...
        
        # Add cost analysis
        cost_level = self._cost_strategy.classify_price(
            self._current_price
        )
        
        battery_reserve = self._cost_strategy.calculate_battery_reserve(
            self._prices,
            datetime.now(),
            self._batt_cap_kwh,
            self._batt_soc
        )
        
        # Make charging decisions
        should_charge = self._cost_strategy.should_charge_battery(
            self._current_price,
            self._batt_soc,
            battery_reserve,
            self._solar_excess_w
        )
        
        return {
            # ... existing data ...
            "cost_level": cost_level,
            "battery_reserve": battery_reserve,
            "should_charge_battery": should_charge,
        }
```

#### 2. Config Flow Integration

Add configuration options for cost thresholds (`config_flow.py`):

```python
# In CONFIG_SCHEMA or options flow
vol.Schema({
    # ... existing options ...
    vol.Optional(
        "cost_cheap_threshold",
        default=1.5
    ): vol.All(vol.Coerce(float), vol.Range(min=0.0, max=10.0)),
    
    vol.Optional(
        "cost_high_threshold",
        default=3.0
    ): vol.All(vol.Coerce(float), vol.Range(min=0.0, max=10.0)),
})
```

#### 3. New Sensors

Add sensors to expose cost strategy data (`sensor.py`):

```python
# sensor.energy_cost_level
@property
def native_value(self):
    return self.coordinator.data.get("cost_level")

# sensor.battery_reserve_recommendation
@property
def native_value(self):
    return self.coordinator.data.get("battery_reserve")

# binary_sensor.should_charge_battery
@property
def is_on(self):
    return self.coordinator.data.get("should_charge_battery")

# binary_sensor.should_discharge_battery
@property
def is_on(self):
    return self.coordinator.data.get("should_discharge_battery")
```

#### 4. Translations

Add translations for new entities (`translations/en.json` and `translations/sv.json`):

```json
{
  "entity": {
    "sensor": {
      "energy_cost_level": {
        "name": "Energy cost level",
        "state": {

## Estimated Savings

### Example Cost Analysis

**Assumptions**:
- 15 kWh battery system
- Daily electricity consumption: 20 kWh
- Price range: 0.8 - 4.0 SEK/kWh
- Battery cycles: 1 per day

**Without Cost Strategy** (simple time-based charging):

- May charge at medium/high prices if pattern shifts
- No optimization for high-cost periods
- Average cost: ~2.5 SEK/kWh
- Monthly cost: ~1,500 SEK

**With Cost Strategy**:
- Charge during cheapest hours (dynamic)
- Discharge during most expensive hours
- Reserve maintained for high-cost windows

## Advanced AI-Like Optimization Strategies

This section describes additional optimization capabilities that can be implemented to create an intelligent, automated energy management system that acts like an AI assistant for cost optimization.

### Overview of Advanced Features

The following enhancements build upon the existing cost strategy to provide:
- **Appliance scheduling recommendations** - Suggest optimal times to run energy-intensive appliances
- **Weather-aware optimization** - Use weather forecasts to improve solar predictions
- **Export profitability analysis** - Determine when selling energy back to grid is worthwhile
- **Load shifting intelligence** - Recommend when to shift flexible loads to cheaper periods
- **Peak shaving strategies** - Minimize demand charges and peak consumption
- **Comfort-aware optimization** - Balance cost savings with user comfort and convenience

---

### 1. Appliance Scheduling Optimization

**Goal**: Suggest optimal times to run flexible appliances like dishwashers, washing machines, and water heaters to minimize energy costs.

#### Input Data Required
- Current and forecast electricity prices (24h)
- Solar production forecast (24h)
- Appliance power consumption profiles
- User preferences (earliest start time, latest completion time)
- Battery state and capacity

#### Optimization Logic

```python
def optimize_appliance_schedule(
    appliance_name: str,
    power_w: float,
    duration_hours: float,
    earliest_start: datetime,
    latest_end: datetime,
    prices: List[PricePoint],
    solar_forecast: List[ForecastPoint],
    battery_soc: float,
    battery_capacity_kwh: float,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Recommend optimal time to run an appliance.
    
    Strategy:
    1. Calculate net cost for each potential start time
    2. Consider solar availability (free energy)
    3. Account for battery state and opportunity cost
    4. Prefer times when excess solar is available
    5. Avoid high-cost periods unless necessary
    
    Returns:
        {
            "optimal_start_time": datetime,
            "estimated_cost_sek": float,
            "cost_savings_vs_now_sek": float,
            "reason": str,
            "alternative_times": List[datetime]
        }
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

#### Key Considerations
- **Solar priority**: Schedule during excess solar production when possible
- **Cost minimization**: Choose cheapest electricity price periods
- **Battery interaction**: Consider if battery could cover the load during expensive times
- **User convenience**: Respect time constraints (e.g., don't suggest running dishwasher at 3 AM unless user allows)
- **Sequential optimization**: If multiple appliances need scheduling, optimize together to avoid conflicts

#### Dashboard Sensor Example

### 2. Weather-Aware Solar Optimization

**Goal**: Improve battery and load management by incorporating weather data to enhance solar production predictions.

#### Input Data Required
- Weather forecast (cloud cover, temperature, precipitation) 
- Historical solar production vs. weather correlation
- Solar panel specifications (azimuth, tilt, capacity)
- Current and forecast prices

#### Enhancement Logic

```python
def adjust_solar_forecast_for_weather(
    base_solar_forecast: List[ForecastPoint],
    weather_forecast: List[WeatherPoint],
    historical_adjustment_factors: Dict[str, float],
) -> List[ForecastPoint]:
    """
    Adjust solar forecast based on weather conditions.
    
    Adjustments:
    - Cloud cover: Reduce forecast by 30-80% based on density
    - Temperature: Account for panel efficiency changes (higher temp = lower efficiency)
    - Snow/rain: Reduce production or flag for cleaning
    - Wind: Generally positive effect on panel cooling
    
    Returns adjusted solar forecast with confidence intervals.
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

#### Integration with Battery Planning

When solar forecast is adjusted downward (cloudy weather expected):
1. **Increase battery reserve** - Store more energy anticipating lower solar production
2. **Advance charging schedule** - Charge earlier than usual to prepare for shortfall
3. **Reduce export plans** - Less likely to have excess solar to sell

When solar forecast is adjusted upward (clear skies expected):
1. **Reduce battery pre-charging** - Solar will provide daytime energy
2. **Plan for export opportunity** - If excess solar expected, prepare to sell
3. **Schedule appliances during solar peaks** - Use free solar energy

#### Dashboard Sensor Example
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: energy_dispatcher
    name: "Adjusted Solar Forecast Today"
    entity_id: sensor.energy_dispatcher_solar_forecast_weather_adjusted
    attributes:
      - base_forecast_kwh
      - weather_adjusted_kwh
      - confidence_level
      - limiting_factor  # e.g., "cloud_cover", "clear"
```

### 3. Export Profitability Analysis

**Goal**: Determine when selling energy back to the grid is financially worthwhile, considering the typically low selling price vs. purchase price.

#### Input Data Required
- Spot price (what grid pays for electricity)
- Purchase price enriched (what you pay including fees)
- Export price (spot price minus fees/reductions)
- Battery state and degradation cost
- Solar production forecast

#### Decision Logic

```python
def should_export_energy(
    current_spot_price: float,
    current_purchase_price: float,
    export_price_per_kwh: float,
    battery_soc: float,
    battery_capacity_kwh: float,
    battery_degradation_cost_per_cycle: float,
    upcoming_high_cost_hours: int,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Determine if exporting is worthwhile.
    
    Key principles:
    1. Default: DON'T EXPORT (selling price usually too low)
    2. Export only if:
       - Spot price is exceptionally high (e.g., >5 SEK/kWh)
       - Battery is full and solar still producing
       - No high-cost periods expected soon (no need to store)
       - Export price - battery degradation > threshold
    
    Returns:

            "opportunity_cost": float,  # value of storing vs selling
            "reason": str
        }
    """
    
    # Calculate thresholds

        return {
            "should_export": False,
            "reason": "Export price too low (< 2 SEK/kWh), better to store or use locally"
        }
    
    # Check if battery is full and solar producing
    if battery_soc >= 95 and solar_excess_w > 1000:
        # Battery full, excess solar, check if export is better than curtailing
        return {
            "should_export": True,
            "export_power_w": solar_excess_w,
            "reason": "Battery full, excess solar would be wasted otherwise"
        }
    
    # Check for exceptional spot price
    if export_price_per_kwh > 5.0 and battery_soc > 80:
        return {
            "should_export": True,
            "export_power_w": 5000,  # Max export rate

            "reason": f"Exceptionally high spot price ({export_price_per_kwh:.2f} SEK/kWh)"

    # Default: don't export, store for later use
    return {
        "should_export": False,
        "reason": "Better to store energy for later use during expensive periods"
    }
```

#### Export Settings Configuration

Users should configure:
- **Minimum export price threshold** (SEK/kWh) - Default: 3.0
- **Battery degradation cost per cycle** (SEK) - Default: 0.50
- **Maximum export power** (W) - Default: 5000
- **Export mode**: 
  - `never` - Never export (default)
  - `excess_solar_only` - Export only when battery full and solar producing
  - `peak_price_opportunistic` - Export during exceptional price spikes
  - `always_optimize` - Actively sell when profitable

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: energy_dispatcher
    name: "Export Opportunity"
    entity_id: binary_sensor.energy_dispatcher_export_opportunity
    state: "{{ states('binary_sensor.energy_dispatcher_export_opportunity') }}"

### 5. Peak Shaving Strategies

**Goal**: Minimize peak power consumption to reduce demand charges and grid strain.

#### Input Data Required
- Real-time power consumption (W)
- Historical peak consumption
- Battery state and power limits
- Time-of-use or demand charge structure
- Solar production

#### Peak Shaving Logic

```python
def calculate_peak_shaving_action(
    current_grid_import_w: float,
    peak_threshold_w: float,
    battery_soc: float,
    battery_max_discharge_w: int,

    solar_production_w: float,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:

    Strategy:
    1. Monitor grid import power
    2. If approaching or exceeding peak threshold, discharge battery
    3. Maintain reserve SOC for essential needs
    4. Prioritize solar usage first
    
    Returns discharge power recommendation.
    """
    # Net demand after solar
    net_demand_w = current_grid_import_w - solar_production_w

  - `disabled` - No peak shaving
  - `demand_charge_aware` - Shave peaks during demand charge periods
  - `continuous` - Always minimize peaks
- **Reserve protection** - Minimum SOC to maintain during peak shaving

### 6. Comfort-Aware Optimization

**Goal**: Balance cost savings with user comfort and convenience.

#### User Preference Inputs

- **Acceptable temperature range** (for heating/cooling optimization)
- **Minimum battery reserve for peace of mind** (%)
- **Quiet hours** (when not to run appliances)
- **Override permissions** (allow system to override user-set schedules)

#### Balanced Optimization Example

```python

    optimization_recommendations: List[Dict],
    user_comfort_priority: str,
    current_temperature: float,
    target_temperature: float,

    """
    if user_comfort_priority == "comfort_first":
        # Filter out aggressive recommendations
        recommendations = [r for r in recommendations 
                          if r.get("user_impact", "medium") == "low"]
        
        # Maintain higher battery reserve
        if battery_soc < 70:
            recommendations = [r for r in recommendations 
                             if r.get("action") != "discharge"]
        
        # Don't shift loads to inconvenient times
