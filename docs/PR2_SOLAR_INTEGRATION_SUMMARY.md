# PR #2: Solar Forecast Integration - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**PR**: Solar forecast integration into optimization planning

---

## Overview

This PR implements solar forecast integration into the optimization planning system, as specified in `OPTIMIZATION_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md` PR #2. Solar forecast data is now actively used to:

1. Reduce battery reserve requirements when solar is expected during high-cost hours
2. Skip unnecessary grid charging when significant solar is coming soon

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `cost_strategy.py`

#### Added Parameter to `calculate_battery_reserve()`
- New parameter: `solar_forecast: Optional[List] = None`
- When provided, reduces reserve requirement by expected solar during high-cost hours

#### Added Method: `_calculate_solar_during_windows()`
```python
def _calculate_solar_during_windows(
    self,
    solar_forecast: List,
    windows: List[tuple[datetime, datetime]]
) -> float:
    """Calculate expected solar production during time windows."""
```

**Logic**:
- Takes solar forecast and high-cost time windows
- Sums expected solar production (kWh) during those windows
- Returns total solar energy expected

#### Reserve Calculation Enhancement
- Reduces reserve requirement by 80% of expected solar (conservative factor)
- Formula: `required_energy -= solar_during_high_cost × 0.8`
- Ensures reserve can't go negative
- Adds debug logging for solar integration

**Example**:
```
Without solar: 4 hours × 1 kW = 4 kWh → 40% reserve (10 kWh battery)
With 3 kWh solar: 4 kWh - (3 × 0.8) = 1.6 kWh → 16% reserve
```

---

### 2. Updated `planner.py`

#### Added Function: `_is_solar_coming_soon()`
```python
def _is_solar_coming_soon(
    current_time: datetime,
    solar_map: dict,
    threshold_w: float = 2000,
    window_hours: int = 2
) -> bool:
    """Check if significant solar production is expected within window."""
```

**Logic**:
- Looks ahead `window_hours` (default: 2 hours)
- Checks if any hour has solar > `threshold_w` (default: 2000W)
- Returns `True` if significant solar is coming

#### Solar-Aware Charging Logic in `simple_plan()`
Added before battery charging decision:
```python
# Check if significant solar is coming soon
solar_coming_soon = _is_solar_coming_soon(
    t, solar_map, threshold_w=2000, window_hours=2
)

# Skip grid charging if solar coming and battery above reserve
if should_charge and solar_coming_soon and current_batt_soc > reserve_soc:
    should_charge = False
    action.notes = f"Skip charge (solar expected soon, SOC: {current_batt_soc:.0f}%)"
```

**Safety**: Only skips charging when SOC > reserve (critical charging still happens)

---

### 3. Updated `coordinator.py`

#### Pass Solar Forecast to Reserve Calculation
In `_update_cost_strategy()`:
```python
# Get solar forecast for reserve calculation
solar_points = self.data.get("solar_points", [])

battery_reserve = self._cost_strategy.calculate_battery_reserve(
    prices=hourly_prices,
    now=now,
    battery_capacity_kwh=batt_cap_kwh,
    current_soc=current_soc,
    solar_forecast=solar_points  # NEW
)
```

---

### 4. Created `tests/test_solar_integration.py`

#### Test Coverage (9 tests)

**TestReserveReductionWithSolar** (3 tests):
1. `test_reserve_reduced_with_solar_during_high_cost` - Verifies reserve is lower with solar
2. `test_reserve_unchanged_with_no_solar` - Verifies reserve same without solar
3. `test_solar_calculation_during_windows` - Tests solar energy calculation

**TestSolarComingSoonLogic** (3 tests):
1. `test_skip_charging_when_solar_coming` - Tests detection of upcoming solar
2. `test_solar_aware_planning_skips_grid_charge` - Tests charging skip logic
3. `test_solar_aware_planning_allows_charge_below_reserve` - Tests safety (charge if critical)

**TestSolarIntegrationEdgeCases** (3 tests):
1. `test_reserve_calculation_with_empty_solar_forecast` - Empty list handling
2. `test_solar_calculation_with_no_overlap` - No solar during windows
3. `test_is_solar_coming_soon_with_empty_map` - Empty map handling

#### Test Results
```
✅ 9/9 tests pass
✅ All existing tests still pass (25/25 cost_strategy, 11/11 export)
✅ Total: 45/45 tests pass
```

### 5. Updated `OPTIMIZATION_RULES_AND_DECISIONS.md`

#### Added Section: Solar Forecast Integration
- Documented battery reserve reduction
- Documented solar-aware charging logic
- Added benefits and examples

#### Updated Sections
- Rule 2: Battery Reserve Calculation (added solar steps)
- Rule 3: Battery Charging Decision (added solar awareness)
- Summary (marked solar as integrated)

## Benefits

### 1. Lower Battery Reserve Requirements
- **Before**: Reserve based only on duration of high-cost hours
- **After**: Reserve reduced by 80% of expected solar during those hours
- **Impact**: More battery capacity available for optimization

**Example**: With 3 kWh solar during 4-hour high-cost period:
- Old reserve: 40%
- New reserve: 16%
- Difference: 24% more capacity available

### 2. Less Grid Charging
- **Before**: Charges during cheap hours regardless of upcoming solar
- **After**: Skips grid charging if solar coming within 2 hours (when safe)
- **Impact**: Reduced grid dependency, lower costs

### 3. More Efficient Battery Usage
- Better utilization of solar forecast data
- Conservative 80% factor ensures reliability
- Safety maintained (critical charging always happens)

---

## Design Decisions

### Conservative 80% Factor
**Why?**: Solar forecasts are not perfect. Weather can change, clouds can appear.

**Options considered**:
- 100%: Too aggressive, risk running out during high-cost hours
- 90%: Still risky with forecast uncertainty
- 80%: ✅ Selected - Good balance of efficiency and safety
- 70%: Too conservative, wastes optimization potential

### 2-Hour Window for "Coming Soon"
**Why?**: Balances responsiveness with stability.

**Options considered**:
- 1 hour: Too short, might charge unnecessarily
- 2 hours: ✅ Selected - Good lead time to avoid charging
- 3 hours: Too long, might skip too many charging opportunities

### 2000W Threshold for "Significant Solar"
**Why?**: Enough power to cover typical house load + some charging.

**Calculation**:
- Typical house: 1000W
- Minimum charging: 1000W
- Total: 2000W

## Integration Points

### Coordinator Flow
```
coordinator._update_cost_strategy()
  └─> Gets solar_points from self.data
  └─> Passes to calculate_battery_reserve()
      └─> Calls _calculate_solar_during_windows()
      └─> Reduces reserve by solar × 0.8
```

### Planner Flow
```
simple_plan()
  └─> For each hour:
      └─> Calls _is_solar_coming_soon()
      └─> If true AND SOC > reserve:
          └─> Skips grid charging
          └─> Sets note: "Skip charge (solar expected soon)"
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Reserve reduction calculation
- ✅ Solar energy calculation during windows
- ✅ Solar coming soon detection
- ✅ Edge cases (empty data, no overlap)

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Full plan generation with solar
- ✅ Charging skip behavior
- ✅ Safety (charging when critical)

### Regression Tests
- ✅ All existing tests still pass
- ✅ No breaking changes

---

## Performance Impact

- **Reserve calculation**: +O(n×m) where n=solar points, m=windows
  - Typical: 24 solar points × 2-3 windows = ~50-75 comparisons
  - Negligible performance impact
  
- **Charging decision**: +O(k) where k=window_hours (2)
  - 2 map lookups per hour
  - Negligible performance impact

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements (not in this PR)
1. **Adaptive conservatism**: Adjust 80% factor based on forecast accuracy
2. **Weather-aware threshold**: Lower threshold on sunny days, higher on cloudy
3. **Solar reliability score**: Track forecast vs actual, adjust factor
4. **Time-of-day awareness**: Different thresholds for morning vs afternoon
