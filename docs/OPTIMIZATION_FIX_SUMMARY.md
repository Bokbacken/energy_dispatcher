# Optimization Fix Summary

## Problem

The Energy Dispatcher optimization plan with real Nordpool price data showed:
- **0% efficiency** - not aligning with actual price levels
- Charging during expensive hours (1.435 SEK/kWh)
- Discharging during medium-price hours (0.970-1.326 SEK/kWh)
- Missing 10 cheap hours for charging
- Missing 2 high hours for discharging

## Root Causes

### 1. Static Thresholds Mismatched to Price Distribution

**Issue**: Fixed thresholds (cheap≤1.5, high≥3.0 SEK/kWh) didn't match actual prices (range 0.506-3.590)

**Impact**:
- Only 4 of 192 hours classified as HIGH (need ≥3.0)
- Most expensive hours (1.4-2.0) classified as MEDIUM
- System didn't discharge when it should

### 2. Overly Conservative Battery Reserve

**Issue**: Assumed 2 kW load, 80% cap → 80% reserve needed

**Impact**:
- Current SOC (61%) below reserve (80%)
- System tried to charge ASAP to reach reserve
- Ignored cheap hour opportunities

## Solution

### Dynamic Cost Thresholds

```python
# New config option (default: enabled)
use_dynamic_cost_thresholds: true

# Calculates from price distribution
cheap_threshold = prices[25th_percentile]  # 0.824 SEK/kWh
high_threshold = prices[75th_percentile]   # 1.418 SEK/kWh
```

**Benefits**:
- Adapts to actual market conditions
- Better identification of cheap/expensive periods
- Consistent classification across price ranges

### Reduced Reserve Conservatism

```python
# Changed assumptions
load_estimate: 2 kW → 1 kW
reserve_cap: 80% → 60%

# Result for 4h high-cost
reserve = (4h × 1kW) / 10kWh × 100 = 40%
```

**Benefits**:
- More realistic load assumption
- Allows opportunistic charging
- Maintains adequate reserve

## Results

### Before (Static Thresholds, 80% Reserve)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Charging | 5 hours at 1.267 SEK/kWh avg |
| - During cheap | 0% |
| - During high | 40% ⚠️ |
| Discharging | 3 hours at 1.117 SEK/kWh avg |
| - During high | 0% ⚠️ |
| **Efficiency** | **0% (POOR)** ⚠️ |

### After (Dynamic Thresholds, 40% Reserve)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Charging | 2 hours at 0.988 SEK/kWh avg |
| - During cheap | 50% ✅ |
| - During medium | 50% |
| Discharging | 1 hour at 1.642 SEK/kWh avg |
| - During high | 100% ✅ |
| **Efficiency** | **75% (GOOD)** ✅ |

### Improvement Summary

- ✅ **+75% efficiency** (from 0% to 75%)
- ✅ **-22% charging cost** (1.267 → 0.988 SEK/kWh)
- ✅ **+47% discharge revenue** (1.117 → 1.642 SEK/kWh)
- ✅ **66% arbitrage margin** (buy 0.988, sell 1.642)

## Configuration

The fix is **enabled by default** with no action required.

To disable dynamic thresholds (not recommended):
```yaml
use_dynamic_cost_thresholds: false
cost_cheap_threshold: 1.5  # Will be used
cost_high_threshold: 3.0   # Will be used
```

## Testing

- ✅ All 25 existing `test_cost_strategy.py` tests pass
- ✅ 4 new tests with real Nordpool data pass
- ✅ Dynamic threshold calculation verified
- ✅ Reserve calculation validated (30-50% range)
- ✅ Optimization quality confirmed (≥50% efficiency)

## Files Changed

- `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/const.py` - New config constant
- `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/config_flow.py` - UI option
- `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/coordinator.py` - Dynamic threshold logic
- `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/cost_strategy.py` - Reserve calculation
- `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/translations/en.json` - English strings
- `custom_components/energy_dispatcher/translations/sv.json` - Swedish strings
- `tests/test_optimization_with_nordpool_data.py` - New test suite
- `docs/optimization_analysis_2025-10-15.md` - Detailed analysis

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Keep dynamic thresholds enabled** (default)
2. Monitor "Cost Level" sensor for price classification
3. Review optimization plan attributes regularly
4. Verify battery capacity and power settings

## Migration

- Existing installations: Automatically enabled on next restart
- No breaking changes
- Can revert to static thresholds if needed
- Configuration is preserved

**Status**: ✅ Complete and tested
**Impact**: High - 75% efficiency improvement
**Risk**: Low - backward compatible, well tested
**User Action**: None required (enabled by default)
